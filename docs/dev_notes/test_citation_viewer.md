# Using the PHP script to view citations generated by the unit tests

This is not necessary but provides an easy way to view the citations being generated by the extension in a web browser.

So it avoids you having to paste citation text into a temporary FSP on WikiTree to see how they would look when on a profile.

It allows you to select which `site` to view. So it is easy to switch back and forth between sites to site how the citation format differs.

## Installing PHP

If you do not have PHP installed on your machine you will need to install it. Some systems come with PHP installed. Mac, for example, does not.

[This page](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.macosx.php) allows you to install it for Mac.

# How to use the script

- First open a terminal of command line window and switch the current director to the Sourcer scripts folder.
- Type: `php -S localhost:8000`
- Open a web browser and go to the URL: `http://localhost:8000/show_test_ref_citations.php`

You should see the UI of the viewer. Select the site that you wish to view the citations for.
