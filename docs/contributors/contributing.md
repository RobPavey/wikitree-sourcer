# Contributing to WikiTreeSourcer

The best way for developers new to the project to contribute is by adding support for a new site. The sites that have been requested have issues in the issues list for this project and can be seen with [this search](https://github.com/RobPavey/wikitree-sourcer/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22Add%20new%20site%22).

See the [README file](../readme.md) for help with setup and a guide on how to add support for a new site.
