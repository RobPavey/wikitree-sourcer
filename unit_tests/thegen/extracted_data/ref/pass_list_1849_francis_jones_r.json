    "Transmigration": "× What is Transmigration? This is to move or pass from one place to another, or migrate from one country to another in order to settle there. Immigration to the U.S. from countries such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland increased dramatically in the late 19th century, due to mounting economic pressures, overpopulation, high unemployment and a lack of open land for new farms. The Homestead Act of 1862 in America gave free land to settlers who developed it for at least five years, and became a particular magnet for Norwegians, Danes, and Swedes, who arrived in massive numbers - 1,000,000 Swedes between 1868–1914, 800,000 Norwegians between 1825–1925, 300,000 Danes between 1820–1920, and 230,000 Finns between 1890–1924. To reach America, it was necessary to travel initially to England in order to then board one of the large transatlantic passenger ships - and this preliminary journey has been recorded for many transmigrating passengers within the BT27 records. Crossings from Scandinavian ports such as Gothenburg, Stavanger or Trondheim brought travellers to the various eastern U.K. ports such as Hull, Newcastle or Grimsby. Alternately, an agent's name may be listed such as Solem or Bowitz, and who operated on behalf of the shipping company of a particular port. Close",
