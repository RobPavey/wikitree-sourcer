He was trained in Geneva as a consecutive interpreter. Dr. Horn applied to Nuremberg for a position as an interpreter and was approved via testing conducted by the United States Army. He worked in Nuremberg, Germany, as a court interpreter, translating English into German, during part of the first War Crimes trial and during the Justice Case. He eventually became Chief Interpreter. After the trials closed in 1949, Dr. Horn joined Léon Dostert at Georgetown University, Washington, DC. Dr. Horn became head of the Division of Interpretation and Translation of the Institute of Languages and Linguistics that Dostert had founded. He later became an American citizen."
